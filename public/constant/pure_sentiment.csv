Babylon has created the most stir recently after their mainnet launch for Bitcoin staking.
 
But even so, it still settles at around 0.1-0.3% CT mindshare compared to the wider crypto market.
 
Even at its peak during the launch it was at around 0.9%.

Still a sector in its early stages - though whether it grows larger is to be seen.

---

In terms of other recent developments for BTCFi, promisingly there's a lot.
 
Significant is Pendle getting involved, which seems a sign of the increased demand/interest.

Yet, it only makes up ~2.5% of mindshare.

Is it overlooked? Let's see üëá

To start, a summary of what DePIN is:

Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks

Where blockchain and tokens are used for infrastructure in the physical world.

---- 

As mentioned, DePIN mindshare currently sits at only 2.5%, roughly 10x smaller than AI, for example.

But, this 2.5% is a result of explosive growth in the past year.

Last September, it was around 0.5% and has been up only since then.

Some of the projects driving it forward:
- @Hivemapper 
- @helium 
- @AethirCloud 
- @ionet 
- @rendernetwork 

----

Helium has been one of the standout performers.

From a token perspective, $HNT has 4x'd since last year and continues to show strength recently.

But off-chain it has also had success, with mindshare and sentiment also on the way up.

Importantly, its impact on the physical world has also been growing, with over 100,000 users of the Helium phone network and partnerships with top US providers.

Some of the people who had been shouting its praises:
- @AustinBarack 
- @Shaughnessy119
- @_tolks

----

Back to DePIN more generally:

Using our AI to pull across all the top sources in crypto, we can summarise the bullish theses people have written.

Solana stands out as the chain of choice, and the areas of most interest tend to revolve around data, energy and mapping.

Now, as you always should, let's also see what people are most bearish about generally.

----

Overall, DePIN appears to be in the early stage of growth, though as we know, in crypto narratives can disappear fast.

The optimistic part about DePIN is it has that real world impact to potentially carry it through.

Now, to do more research, as you should - where's the best place to do it?

But who are the people driving forward the conversations & excitement?

Let‚Äôs take a look using Kaito‚Äôs data üëá

Despite minimal marketing, Hyperliquid has already risen to the top of mindshare rankings for perpetuals over the last three months, surpassing established projects like dYdX and WOO.

On a more granular level:

Hyperliquid went from 9% mindshare this time last year, between the top perp projects, to now averaging around 40%, close to a 5x increase.

So who are the voices pushing forward this mindshare?

Using Kaito‚Äôs KOL (yes, sorry for saying KOL) Analytics, we can find out.

Here are the rankings for the top accounts on CT that have tweeted the most about HL over the past 3 months:

üëë @0xOmnia
2) @fiege_max
3) @TheCryptoNexus
4) @based16z
5) @KingJulianIAm 

We can also find out the rankings for accounts based on their contribution to mindshare, weighted by engagement from the smartest accounts on CT (Smart Engagement).

üëë @crypto_noodles
2) @0xOmnia
3) @fiege_max
4) @based16z
5) @wardaddycapital
6) @KingJulianIAm
7) @chameleon_jeff
8) @TheCryptoNexus

This helps to know who is making the most impact in terms of growing mindshare, but also who is making content that is connecting with the smartest, most influential people on CT.

Impressions only paint a part of the story.

Overall, for projects looking to grow, and analyse their growth, social tracking is essential.

And Hyperliquid is one of the best examples of how external marketing can play a huge role in growing not only your presence, but also your usage - with many of the top accounts also creating referrals.

1825810062733906103,"Is DeFi so back?

After being pushed aside by other narratives, there are signs of a DeFi resurgence going on.

Let's take a look üëá

First up, mindshare for DeFi in general has been on a 3 month up-trend, close to doubling in % from 7 to 14 since the start of this year.

Out of all the DeFi projects, the two gaining the most mindshare % wise out of any in the past 30 days are $AAVE & $DRIFT.

AAVE has been *the* outperformer in terms of price, mindshare, and sentiment too. 

Closing in on its March high, and sentiment higher than any time in the last 12 months.

Here's a summary from our AI Copilot on why people are bullish üëá

Another way to look at DeFi's recovery is the segment's mindshare in comparison to others.

To put it into perspective, despite Memecoins seeming like *the* topic recently, DeFi has close to the same mindshare, with both only falling behind AI.

In the last 30 days:
- AI: 21.7%
- Memes: 13.07%
- DeFi: 12.18%

Though early days, the off-chain indicators are very positive.

Thoughts on October‚Äôs remainder (considering WSOT by Bybit starting on Oct. 10th):

Expect October to be volatile and manipulative. The market will try its best to shake you out of solid positions. But if your entries are near range lows, you can stay in longer than expected.

Remember, the $70-72k range target isn‚Äôt changing in the next two months. Until then, here‚Äôs a rough guide for possible price action (PA):

üìâ Range Highs: Focus on risk management and de-risking if we see a swing failure pattern (SFP).

üìä Mid-Range: Above this level, we likely push toward range highs. If we fall below it, we‚Äôre likely heading back to range lows.

üìà Range Lows: If the price holds here for a day or more, it's a prime zone to bid on your favorite coins, especially majors.

1812196626083262622,"‚ÄúKoalas are fucking horrible animals.

They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life.

Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end.

Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals.

Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. 

This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain‚Ä¶

Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.‚Äù",LomahCrypto,8.0,Negative,NaN,2024-10-10 08:59:35.758568,2024-10-10 08:59:35.758568

For Trump family members to bless DJT prior to the launch, they would presumably have to get some consideration in return, ie. money.  So with the proceeds, are you going to pay Trump family members or not?  Because if they don't get paid, it proves you are full of shit.

1802181972669931741,"My take on Ansem/Cobie etc.

Even though Cobie et al. are right that celebrities entering the space are mostly value extractive grifters, I feel for Ansem that he's a punching bag for people's general discontent at the obvious truth: that almost all the crypto projects are value extractive grifts anyways. 
 Tech, no tech, meme, no meme - behind virtually every token is/was a phony narrative and a pnd (pump and dump).

Ansem, just like all of us, isn't bound to the virtue-signaled rules that everyone opines about but few can walk (like turning down 7 figs to tweet a casino link.  ok, so sue me.)  It seems unfair to hit him on doing a space with iggy - it's an impossible standard.  Yes it gives iggy a platform, yes people will get hurt, but so what.  It's an inefficiency that people will exploit, until there aren't enough desperate suckers zipping their life savings into this shit.  Because it's all pnds.

However, I agree with the general consensus that Ansem has lost touch with the reality that these are mostly all scams (or he's being willfully ignorant to his benefit).  He deserves a bit of pushback for that. 
 Getting 100x'es is a thing of the past, except maybe for the sharpest minds, or the people running the casino.  No not every project is some huge gamechanger that will transform society, sometimes its just a fucking pnd.  I mean how many pnd's do we have to go through until you figure out, it's all pnds.  Listen up.  It's all pnds.  Pencils down, kid.  The answer?  It's all pnds.

But at the same time, I mean what the hell else is Ansem going to tweet about wrt crypto.  And whatever he is tweeting, well... ""it's good for the game"", to use the poker saying.  In this case, the ""game"" being to find another desperate sucker to buy the coin, nft, option, perp, governance token, presale, ico, points, or whatever else bullshit you dump on them.  It's almost an art to convince someone a weekend hackathon project is somehow $1bn on paper.  It's all pnds.

This is really no judgment against Ansem though.  Being the main ""talking head"" in the space almost necessitates a Jim Cramer-esque demeanor of excitement towards all these coins.  Otherwise what else are you going to do, be a monk?  It's all pnds.

And I'm not saying I'm any better, by the way.  We are living in a world of sin, and when players enter the squid game looking for riches, few will win, many will die.  So let's not pretend they can all make it by all doing the same shit - almost all of the shit here is a zero or negative sum game.  You only win when others lose.  In the case of memecoins, they are already highly cabal-controlled and will be ""full stack hitlered"" at increasingly faster speeds going forward as the meta evolves towards equilibrium.  Because yep, you guessed it: it's all pnds.

1767146132747288710,"By now you already know the narrative: memecoin supercycle.

How did we get here?  Let's walk back a bit.  Why do people invest so much in companies that don't pay any dividends?  You might say ""share buybacks"", but that is basically saying ""someone else will buy it"".  What seems so solid - real companies and profits - in some cases become more about memes and narratives than people want to admit.

Today you can find stocks that probably trade well above any nuts and bolts value. In memecoin terms, TSLA is almost like an ""Elon Coin"", and that's why it trades so high.  As long as people want to buy, it can remain this way.

To make clear the silliness, imagine you own a bunch of real estate that has some valuation, but when packaged together, the package somehow trades at many multiples of that value.  It's hard for normies to wrap their head around, but this ""meme premium"" is from speculators creating their own zero sum game around that asset, hoping to sell it to another speculator.

What is happening?  Gambling revenues are booming, as people are either getting increasingly desperate or rich.  Whether the move is TSLA calls or shitcoin perps, these are essentially additional outlets for gambling.  In this case, many on CT are gambling addicts, hoping to catch a 100x by buying into (insert cashgrab solana shitter here).

Ponzis have been part of crypto (for better or worse) for a decade, including the ICO era, NFTs, play to earn, and so on.  Almost all projects were cash grabs that started with a flimsy premise, created a ponzi/token around it, and sold out like hotcakes.  Left curve buyers bought into the premise and right curve buyers bought in because they were first, and the price went up.

The arrival of these memecoins, especially the ones with no utility, are the purest expression of the ponzi, as the ponzi is right in your face, the only thing it promises. It's also more efficient than dealing with NFTs or other complicated systems.

Another aspect is that liquidity can hide the ball. Shitcoins (and nfts) use low liquidity to meme that your bag is more valuable than it is. If for example a tiny bit of some shitcoin trades at some high price, that doesn't mean the sum of everyone's bag is worth that much, yet most are inclined to believe it. This is a kind of arbitrage on perception vs reality that these assets exploit basically.

Anyways, back to today.  In everybody's dream outcome, BTC marches to infinity ($100k+), we magically get a lot more retail investors who want to buy your meme coins, and your girlfriend has a girlfriend.  And if ETF flows continue (or accelerate), then yeah, that's where we are going.  So I recommend staying on the train.

But I think there is a middle ground option, and I'm getting prepared for that possibility, where ETF flows taper off.  Every indicator is flashing now.  OG retail is definitely here, and they are spraying.  Influenzas are all shilling cashgrab shitters daily.  Funding is 100%apy to long, sometimes much higher on alts.  Fast money from BTC appreciation went everywhere, but some places are more leaky than others and people will have to take an L at some point.  Also, ETH is still an expensive chain to use for most applications.

A ponzi system needs more and more oxygen to breathe, and unless it gets that oxygen from somewhere, it can quickly deflate.

To buy memecoins now, you have to think who the last buyers will be.  In regards to small cap memes, most of retail will get sucked in by manipulated charts/PA and astroturfed discussions, and their money will get funneled into professional shitcoin producers.  Today, Twitter is a battlefield of which KOL can shill which cashgrab shitter memecoin, those posts get boosted by these pirates and you will get slaughtered on chain.  Yes, someone extremely determined can win.  But if you choose to play on chain as a low info normie, just know that there will be few winners and many losers.

To leverage long now, you have to pay obscene funding and fees.  It's a completely different bet than spot for this reason.  There is a difference between what is likely to happen and what is a bad bet, eg. celtics probably win, but laying 10-1 is a bad bet.   And with this much juice, this is where it starts to get into bad bet territory.

Also, a lot of gamblers are getting pushed towards more and more leverage which amplifies the possibility of a death wick - that April 2021 kind of wick where I lost $100m in a day.  There, bitcoin went from 68k to 40k.  Study the run up in 2020-2021, when bigger wicks were increasing in occurrence.  Study 2019.  Hell, study every year in the book.

Today, I think you should stay on the train.  Be 100% in spot crypto, mostly majors, and play somewhat defensively, knowing we are in later innings.  Don't lose your shirt.  These indicators (extremely high funding, extremely bullish sentiment, mania, etc.) can get more extreme, but they always reset in the end.  For every gigalong getting liquidated, there is another guy buying that liquidation. Be that guy.  This is now a game of survival.  Most will not survive.  All you have to do to win, is survive.

For me, my home run is to grab a giant red wick or two on the path to infinity, and make money both ways.  But whichever way the ball goes, I will be a winner.  I have never forgotten the value of a dollar, and I never will.  Champions adjust.  I'll see you at the citadel.

1821865386293309860,"Without proper long-term time frame analysis, buying fear is basically catching falling knives. And without solid short-term time frame analysis and risk management, you won‚Äôt be able to position yourself and take too many losses. Multiple time frame analysis is paramount.

I am always switching time frames when watching my charts, and I am continuously monitoring new candles that open. Based on your directional bias you need to plot the outcome (body with lower- and upper shadows) of your candles and fit them like a puzzle piece into the previous ones. How far could your shadows go and still reverse in time to create the body that you envisioned? If you do this for every candle, you will be able to blend all those wicks and bodies into one movement. The liquidity pools of certain time frames will become the shadows of the other ones. Once you have mastered this, you will also get clues from these movements. When it gets close but doesn‚Äôt materialize, that‚Äôs a sign of inner strength or exhaustion, depending on the situation. When you do this for years, you familiarized yourself with most of the candle patterns that occur. In some occasions I‚Äôm able to completely rule out a certain price direction (within a certain timeframe) solely based on the closure of the previous candle. It‚Äôs a beautiful game where you‚Äôre just continuously trying to predict every single candle on every single timeframe, while of course going through trial and error.

Loading up on size in extreme volatility is difficult as your margin of error is much higher than during consolidations or regular breakouts. It‚Äôs necessary to scale into that position by using multiple entries that each have their own separate setups. Only by respecting those setups you‚Äôll be able to keep building your position in a way that fits your risk management. If you would just keep buying while the price descends, you can end up in huge losses when your bias turns out to be wrong.

Ever since the ETFs were introduced, I've had a lot of difficulty seeing my kind of setups in the charts, or have mostly seen them playing out differently.

It's rare to have a new force entering the market and derange your strategies, but eventually you can overcome these changes and adapt. A similar situation happened to me on the 25th of January in 2017. On this day the Chinese exchanges finally introduced trading fees, and the quality and technical consistency in the Chinese charts suddenly disappeared. Ordinary traders and/or investors probably didn't notice a thing, but for me, everything changed.

Patience is key in order to get back in sync with the market. I will continue to test my setups before I start trading my regular position sizes.

1732336962722300042,"Nailing your entries requires a combination of perfecting your risk/reward setups and mastering your multiple timeframe analysis. Both of them are vital to me in order to reach consistent profitability.

https://t.co/cLrdkgS3i7

https://t.co/duzgqU8TnB

I highly improved my risk/reward trading back in 2014-2016 on the OkCoin Futures. As a novice trader I always leveraged my positions on 10x or 20x, so finding great entries was crucial to avoid the infamous margin calls. After around 2 years and 400.000 transactions, I was finally getting better at finding the ‚Äòpoints of no return‚Äô (PNRs) in the chart. Those points often reveal themselves by leaving small clues in the lower timeframes. But without a full and complete analysis of all the timeframes, you will not be able to spot and/or anticipate them. Clues are only clues when found in the right place and at the right time. Next to this, your risk/reward setups need to be outstanding if you want your overall performance to survive multiple failed entries.

Before looking for PNRs, you need to determine the points of acceleration (PAs) in the chart for both bulls and bears. At these price points, the candles will accelerate as they will hit liquidity and/or change sentiment. Your furthest PA is often your target or your breakout zone, and your closest PA is often, but not always, the first step towards that zone. The closer they are the better, and more PAs mean more gusts in your sail, especially needed if you‚Äôre going upwind.

After you have established your roadmap (how do you need the chart to move before and after your entry) for both the bullish and the bearish case, the beautiful battle begins: which candles should print in what way in order to reach which PA in what required time. Only when you are completely zoned in on synchronizing your timeframes (from 1minute until 1month), you will be able to read that battle. It shouldn‚Äôt matter if you are bullish or bearish because the chart will show you who‚Äôs winning which timeframes. It is at this time that your bias (that includes fundamental analysis) is either confirmed or proven wrong. Don‚Äôt act on the first weaknesses or strengths, the battle takes and gives, but determine the lines in the sand and the inflection points, that‚Äôs where every bullet counts.

Now that you‚Äôve got your entry for a short-term swing and the roadmap that it should follow, will it manifest in the medium and/or long term? Keep analysing all the upcoming candles, plan all the different ways that they should or could close to either confirm or disprove your trade. Ask yourself continuously why certain candles closed in what kind of way, and how they could fit into your time-based roadmap. Keep rewriting the outcomes when candles close atypical, because every candle should close in a way that fits into your narrative. And if it doesn‚Äôt, find out if you missed something, because it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that you‚Äôre in the wrong trade. After your entry you need to monitor and investigate every step and melt the candles and their respective timeframes into one movement.

Unfortunately becoming consistently profitable in trading requires a lot more than just the above two aspects. It‚Äôs one of those professions where you have to master all elements in order to make money consistently. A steep learning curve and perseverance will get you through the first part. The middle part is a combination of technicals and behavioural finance. The last part is all about passion.",AguilaTrades,,Neutral,NaN,2024-10-10 08:59:35.758568,2024-10-10 08:59:35.758568

It's not easy to let go of your winners, especially when your analysis for the near future showed a lot more potential. To become biased in one direction is a very dangerous thing and often turns into a death spiral for your portfolio. 

To prevent this, you need to write down your own set of rules. These rules can involve indicators, patterns, candles or anything fundamental. Whenever you are confronted with one of them, you need to set your ego aside and close. Rules are to be ruled by, and yesterday I saw one of mine in the chart.

The final step is acceptance. You need to completely forget about the trade you just closed and look forward with a fresh mindset.

A yield-bearing stablecoin that doesn't rely on banking rails. I get the idea and it definitely has a need in crypto.

What I don't get is the speculative funding rate farm done on a massive billions of dollars scale.

Delta hedging derivatives positions has never been done in this large of a scale for good reason, because it will push yields down and it stops working.

The irony here is that Ethena is pushing funding rates down themselves with their massive uncapped TVL.

A prolonged negative funding rate would destroy any yield that USDe has earned up until now and cause a depeg.

The faster the TVL grows (without corresponding OI), the lower funding rates will go and cause its own downfall.

A simple cap on Ethena TVL that increases alongside funding rates/OI could fix this. Trying to maximise deposits is just greed at this point.

If you wanted to create an internet bond, you want to do so at the lowest risk as possible.

The stETH yield could solely do the job of creating a yield-bearing stablecoin by itself without the need for this funding rate farm.

1777382939153621340,"We are close to a local market top (if not already in one). 

Here is why:

The BTC ETF inflows are indeed good for business, no denying there. However, these inflows don't trickle down to altcoins.

Investors are buying and holding on brokerage accounts, and even if they take profit by selling, there is no path for that money to flow into altcoins onto the exchanges that we use.

Most altcoins are denominated by USDT these days instead of BTC so the idea that altcoins should go up alongside BTC is outdated.

""But we have low funding rates?"" Correct. 

Funding rates are low which should be a bullish sentiment as it means open interest isn't net long by a lot. 

The issue is that Ethena has popularised the cash-carry trade of holding spot and shorting perpetual futures that many people are now also doing this.

Ethena itself holds a massive chunk of OI that shorts perpetual futures, helping to keep funding rates down. 

As always, think 2 steps ahead. Low funding rates = bearish.

Retail is already here and fully deployed. Taxi drivers trading memecoins and normies discussing cryptocurrencies is a classic top signal tale as old as time. Study the Shoeshine boy Indicator.

The bullish sentiment in 2023 was that retail isn't here yet and they will buy our bags at a higher price. 

THIS HAS HAPPENED ALREADY. Retail has bought your bags and they are holding. 

For the price to continue increasing at this pace it assumes that there will be an even greater influx of retail entering crypto than before. This does not seem possible.

I can go on and on about the other top signals such as people raising $200m in presales just by tweeting an address on which every single one lost their ""presale investors"" a significant amount of money.

I'm sure people are already aware of these other top signals so I won't go into detail there.

If you objectively analysed the current state of the market a few months ago, these would be the exact top signals that you would warn your future self to look out for.

The crypto market has simply gone up way too high, way too fast. A pull-back will happen, similar to June 2021. The risk/reward for going long just isn't favourable anymore. 

If BTC goes to $100k, that's only a 30% move up from now, requiring an additional $400b to its market cap. Whereas BTC declining back to $45k seems like a healthy pull-back.

The same concepts also apply to the S&P 500 btw, I believe that there is a local market top forming similarly.

It's entertaining to see average traders call @Rewkang a solid counter.

In 2023, I relentlessly countertraded timeline shills and other traders' ideas around the clock. Sometimes I won, other times I got blasted. In 2023 I backtested all cashtag mentions from dozens of traders to  have a more quanttitative approach. 

The thesis was: Is indiscriminetaly countertrading X Y Z profitable.?

This is also how a great friendship with Awatwap @Awawat_Trades started.

Get dm¬¥s sometimes from people saying they feel ¬¥bad¬¥ or ¬¥guilty¬¥ about selling btc since they know it will be worth so much more in the future

1: yes, it is a good idea to be disciplined if you are building a stack. Money = energy, and the more money you save, the more energy you have, and that energy will in time ¬¥work for you¬¥ through yields/returns once you have enough. So yes, to build your stack you have to be disciplined, but.....

2: it is also important to be aware and live right ¬¥now¬¥. One day every person will die, so you don¬¥t want to eternally save for the future. The goal of living is to live, and not to eternally keep stacking and never spending anything. Someone felt guilty selling btc to buy something for his wife for example, which is strange because one should never feel guilty about spending some coin on expressing your affection or love for someone you care about deeply. For example, i love buying flowers for my wife every week and am not going to think ¬¥goh...this small amount of btc will be x100 one day so i should not buy her flowers¬¥. Flowers or any other nice objects improve our quality of living so it is fine to spend on that without feeling guilty. I will also help her set up her company which gives her purpose in life and will generate some income, less than when we keep it in btc for sure, but it is more important for me she can do what she loves. 

So it is all about balance. Stack enough money (energy) so one day that money will work for you while at the same time trying to make the most of living/enjoying ¬¥the moment¬¥ without going out of control.",Tim_4444,5.0,Positive,btc,2024-10-10 08:59:35.758568,2024-10-10 08:59:35.758568

Anyway, i send her to visit one of my teachers/masters who helps me with certain things (learning never stops in life), and the only thing she said afterwards was ¬¥woaw, thank you, now i understand better why you are so interested in this¬¥. 
Direct experience is important....it really is, only way to open one¬¥s  mind is to experience new states of being. There are always new things to learn, the path of growth (and un-growth, because real growth is unlearning things), is eternal. 

Don¬¥t lock yourself away in the prison of fixed beliefs and habits.

Stop it, i made money (btc) trading shitcoins just like most on here, made shitload of mistakes to learn, had massive ups and downs in wealth (remember 2022..barely survived that myself), only difference to most is that i did intense inner work for 10 years before i started doing crypto so i did not lose myself mentally/emotionally in the process of doing crypto.

1843365471309181432,"Lies & deceit & temptation in crypto(twittter)
long tweet

As shared before, i will publicly share what happens to a crypto-twitter account when it grows. 

last time i disclosed it was: 20k/30k at least a month in offers, promotions, seedrounds, partnership offers with exhanges, offers to scam/rugpull pump/dump (meme)-coins, invitations with private flights etc. 

account has doubled again since then so time for some new disclosures:

1: apparently the more honest one is, the harder people want to get you ¬¥onboard¬¥. Now that i did some spaces with ¬¥bigger¬¥ names in crypto, most big exchanges offering partnerships now, funded vip accounts etc. Getting offered more serious seedrounds as well in exchange for support of course, usually a requirement is to put the name of the coin in my profile or pinned tweet. 

2: dm¬¥s to participate in what i would call criminal behaviour: ¬®we¬¥ll give you 5% of the entire float of this meme-coin if you help us shill this at certain dates. Since your account is not promoting any coins yet, we would offer your incremental rewards once the meme-coins reaches 1M, 10M, 100M valuations¬®. Usually a reward for every tweet as well, around 1000 usdt or more. 

3: more invitations to crypto-gatherings, as usual requesting talks on mindset, inner development etc. 

4: since i answer most dm¬¥s, (rich) people or large accounts think they can simply dm me and say things like ¬®dude, i need to come and relax, heavily f**cked up, can i come next week¬®. Just a total lack of any respect and immediate assumption they deserve attention simply because they have money. This is not a place for you to come pass your hang-over after a Token2049 event, get serious.  

5: disadvantage for sure of larger account is that i can no longer post any pictures of views, surroundings, or mention anything about where i go or live. Geo-locaters are crazy, and i got dm¬¥s of people that really try ¬¥that kind of tree grows there, that kind of stone wall is found there¬¥. In short, sick shit. So deleted all pictures and all that stuff

6: disadvantage is also every word one says is scrutinized. Can¬¥t mention a coin or people claim i am in league with them, can¬¥t mention a meme or the main meme-account re-tweets it. I invite someone on the spaces that might have made a mistake in the past, and somehow my entire integrity is questioned. I mean...don¬¥t like the spaces, just log off

7: someone wanted to create a tim inner development meme coin, something i once mentioned as a joke, and get me on board to promote it.....ü§£ü§£. people are so weird

In short, interesting journey. Will keep sharing everything on the way to 100k followers

And as always, anyone can try, but i will never sacrifice integrity or honesty. I trained with serious esoteric masters, and have developed a level of energetic sensitivity which i would say most people do not have.
Interested? Look at my pinned tweets or website. 
This also means i can literally feel the effects lying or pretending has on the energy of a person or on myself, so i don¬¥t engage in that behaviour for more profound reasons. Now this does not mean i judge others that do engage in ¬¥questionable¬¥ behaviour, each person will suffer and learn hard lessons according to their state of development since humans only grow throw friction and suffering. Anyone can do what they want of course, but i will keep providing insights why so many large crypto-twitter accounts eventually compromise integrity and collapse under the weight of attention and temptations. 

As always, don¬¥t throw away your integrity and well-being just for some $, and just look inside once in a while

Love to you all

Have a good fried visiting who came here years ago when he was seriously messed up. 
Now years later:
- strong, fit, healthy
- amazing solid energy on the inside
- life on track and flowing well, finances going ok, nice relationship
- just a stunning reversal of life-circumstances

How? For years now every single day doing hours of inner work. He follows damo mitchell¬¥s taoist lotus nei gong system, strongly recommend it to anyone, and results are impressive. 
But how did my friend get so far? 
Only 1 reason: being extremely serious about his development and putting in 1000s of hours of alone pratice and going to retreats and trainings. 

Regarding abilities, some people think that when i talk about inner development this is some kind of semi-joke, like mindfulness, feeling a bit better etc. It is totally the contrary: with serious inner development i mean putting in a shitload of hours of inner work, in whatever system you choose, and this has results. 
For example, personally:
- don¬¥t experience, stress, anxiety, worry. ever. my state is one of surrender and direct realisation
- higher pain threshold
- being able to have a ¬¥mini-orgam/profound release¬¥, in every part of body, just a delicious explosive feeling, whenever i want
- mental abilities: being able to focus extremely, read faster, analyse faster, just being able to use the mind much more efficient since it is not clogged up with emotional garbage
- can turn of thoughts through letting go and focussing on the ¬¥now¬¥. try it out, this is not easy to do, most people are tormented by their thoughts. 
- intuitive abilities: feeling almost what others think, great ¬¥intuition¬¥ on what people are struggling with, immediately can pick up if people are ok or not, great ¬¥flow¬¥ in life, what other people would call a ridiculous amount of good luck
- direct experience of unity, oneness, god is all, allah is all, tao, whatever you want to call it. 
- profound surrender/jhani/absorption states in mediation

How does he maintain mental discipline (in his life, crypto, and poker). How to cultivate a healthy ego. How he deals with stress. How he applies philosophy in real life. Mind and body hacks.

2: pregnancy  
3: give birth (vagina destroyed)  
4: breastfeed (sour nipples)  
5: menopause  
6: hormonal fluctuations

8: can¬¥t take of your shirt anywhere 
9: idiots that always try to hit on you  
10: 1000s of years of repression and cruelty by men  

Men:
1: strong testosteron in veins which makes impulses harder to control 
2: excessive need to display power and strength 
3: die earlier than women  
4: ridiculized for not being sensitive 
5: women that often try to drain your power 
6: supposed to always be ¬¥the provider¬¥ 
7: prostate problems/leaking with age 
8: nowadays often discriminated against by ¬¥woke¬¥ or ¬¥feminist¬¥ radicals  

If every man lived in the body of a woman for a month, and every woman in the body of a man for a month, mutual understanding and respect would be much bigger, but since we can¬¥t do that, the best way is to understand the opposite energy (see book recommendations underneath).   

- All these clown tate like influencers online, that denigrate women, are the weakest and dumbest men in the world.    
- All these clown like feminists, that denigrate men, are the weakest and dumbest women in the world.  

- A strong man treats women with the respect they deserve, understand female energy, and educates himself on how to balance his own masculine energy to feel complete on the inside to share that with the opposite sex without becoming obsessive and crazy. 

 - A strong women treats men with the respect they deserve, understand male energy, and educates herself on how to balance her own female energy to feel complete on the inside to share that with the opposite sex without becoming obsessive and crazy

A bitcoin standard or any other hard money standard might make the financial system less destructive, have people think more long term, and end all the crazy shit that flows out of the fiat system, but it won¬¥t make people happier or more content. Only real inner development and serious inner practice can take humans to a level of consciousness higher than what the average human currently displays. This has been known for 1000s of years since it has been said across 100s of different esoteric traditions throughout history. 

Want proof? Most of us on here in cryptotwitter are into crypto and bitcoin and how many can honestly say that they are truly content and happy? 
Very few...very very few
And did having hard money (bitcoin) truly make you appreciate life more and reach a broader state of consiouscness?
Exactly....no. Most just want more bitcoin and lost themselves in their greed for more hard money or auto-destroyed themselves due to an over-identification with a small sense of ¬¥I¬¥.

Thanks to receiving so many messed up crypto-people for help, while at the same time having a nice network of successful friends in crypto too, got quite a unique perspective over the years

1: i know firsthand the utter devastation this space can cause emotionally, mentally, energetically (meaning all the stress causes blockages in the subtle body), spiritually (people lose themselves totally), and how hard it is to recover from that. Usually caused by only 1 thing: ego, which means over-identification with a limited sense of self out of which all other destructive behaviour flows: faulty risk management, loss of balance, ego out of control, destructive tendencies, etc. 

2: i also know that most that do become multi-millionaires thanks to crypto, and stay multi-millionaires, while also becoming more content, are usually disciplined people that learned the hard way to apply proper risk management, take care of themselves, and take profit while not being consumed by the idea that more money is more contentment. In short, they kept their inner development going while growing their $ & btc stack. Of course there are exceptions, but overall the friends i have that ¬¥made¬¥ it financially only did so thanks to seriously working on themselves at the same time.

Some might be a bit higher grade nuclear waste, but most is low grade nuclear waste

Have you ever even read a whitepaper like the bittensor one, or any other of these fancy l2¬¥s or all that shit? All the fancy words, blablabla. This is typical nuclear waste that is wrapped up a bit better to look like high grade nuclear waste. Same for all other alts. 
Nice thing about memes is that they are openly the lowest grade nuclear waste, and we all know it will be worthless in the next bearmarket

Does this mean all this shit won¬¥t pump like crazy? Of course not, as we all know high grade nuclear waste can be refined into nuclear warheads and they can explode, so yes, some of this shit will go crazy again, that is why i am holding a wide variety

But never forget, it is and remains nuclear waste, and you gotta dump it before it goes to zero in the next bearmarket. Stay close to it too long, and you get radiation poisioning, become sick, and lose it all.

2: To be healthy, don¬¥t eat carbs & sugar & buy in supermarket. Eat protein & fat & grow own food  
3: To be happy, don¬¥t look outside like everyone else. Look inside  
4: To live your destiny, don¬¥t listen to others. Listen to your heart & intuition which nobody tells you to do
5: To stay strong, don¬¥t focus on physical body only like everyone else. Cultivate chi & jing, save your sexual energy and train your tendons and mind and spirit
6: To get a real education, don¬¥t follow the usual academic system unless absolutely needed for a profession that has your passion, follow your own desire to learn and use all the info that is available for free
7: To get attention & a message across, don¬¥t talk a lot. Talk less but talk with extreme focus which power comes from cultivating silence.
